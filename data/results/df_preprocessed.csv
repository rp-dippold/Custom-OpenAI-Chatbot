0,"On 6 February 2023, at 04:17 TRT (01:17 UTC), a Mw 7."
1,8 earthquake struck southern and central Turkey and northern and western Syria.
2,The epicenter was 37 km (23 mi) west–northwest of Gaziantep.
3,The earthquake had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XII (Extreme) around the epicenter and in Antakya.
4,It was followed by a Mw 7.
5,7 earthquake at 13:24.
6,This earthquake was centered 95 km (59 mi) north-northeast from the first.
7,There was widespread damage and tens of thousands of fatalities.
9,The Mw 7.
10,"8 earthquake is the largest in Turkey since the 1939 Erzincan earthquake of the same magnitude, and jointly the second-largest in the country, after larger estimates for the 1668 North Anatolia earthquake."
11,It is also one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded in the Levant.
12,It was felt as far as Egypt and the Black Sea coast of Turkey.
13,"There were more than 30,000 aftershocks in the three months that followed."
14,The seismic sequence was the result of shallow strike-slip faulting along segments of the East Anatolian and Sürgü–Çardak faults.
16,"There was widespread damage in an area of about 350,000 km2 (140,000 sq mi), about the size of Germany."
17,"An estimated 14 million people, or 16 percent of Turkey's population, were affected."
18,Development experts from the United Nations estimated that about 1.
19,5 million people were left homeless.
20,"The confirmed death toll stood at 59,259: 50,783 in Turkey and 8,476 in Syria."
21,It is the deadliest earthquake in what is now present-day Turkey since the 526 Antioch earthquake and the deadliest natural disaster in its modern history.
22,It is also the deadliest in present-day Syria since the 1822 Aleppo earthquake; the deadliest worldwide since the 2010 Haiti earthquake; and the fifth-deadliest of the 21st century.
23,Damages were estimated at US$104 billion in Turkey and US$14.
24,"8 billion in Syria, making them the fourth-costliest earthquakes on record."
26,"Damaged roads, winter storms, and disruption to communications hampered the Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency's rescue and relief effort, which included a 60,000-strong search-and-rescue force, 5,000 health workers and 30,000 volunteers."
27,"Following Turkey's call for international help, more than 141,000 people from 94 countries joined the rescue effort."
29,"Central southern Turkey and northwestern Syria are affected by the interaction between three tectonic plates; the African Plate, Arabian Plate and Anatolian Plate."
30,The boundary between the African and Arabian plates is represented by the Dead Sea Transform (DST)—a major zone of left-lateral strike-slip fault—it accommodates the relative northward movement of Arabia with respect to Africa.
31,The northern end of the DST truncates at the East Anatolian Fault (EAF) another major left-lateral strike-slip fault zone that accommodates the overall westward movement of the Anatolian Plate as it is extruded in that direction by the northward movement of the Arabian Plate.
32,The DST and EAF meet at the Marash Triple Junction.
33,"The EAF continues west of the triple junction, forming the boundary between the African and Anatolian plates, linking into the Cyprus arc to the west via the Latakia Ridge."
34,"The 700 km-long (430 mi) EAF is subdivided into seven segments, from the northeast; the Karlıova, Ilıca, Palu, Pütürge, Erkenek, Pazarcık and Amanos segments."
35,"The Amanos segment is also considered part of the DST by some geologists, or a transitional structure between the EAF and DST by others."
36,"A northern strand to the EAF has also been recognized, including the Sürgü, Çardak, Savrun, Çokak, Toprakkale, Yumurtalık, Karataş, Yakapınar and Düziçi–İskenderun segments."
37,The estimated slip rate on the main strand of the EAF system decreases south-westwards from 10 mm (0.
38,39 in) per year on the Karlıova segment down to 2.
39,9 mm (0.
40,11 in) per year on the Amanos segment.
41,"On the northern strand, a slip rate of 2."
42,5 mm (0.
43,098 in) per year was estimated on the Çardak segment.
44,The Sürgü-Çardak Fault is an east-west striking 160 km (99 mi) long fault that runs north of the EAF.
45,It branches away from the EAF west of Çelikhan and extends westwards to Göksun.
46,Comprising two segments; the Sürgü Fault runs 70 km (43 mi) between Çelikhan and Nurhak; the Çardak Fault runs 90 km (56 mi) between Nurhak and Göksun.
47,Seismicity on the fault is low—the only associated earthquake was a M 6.
48,8 event in 1544.
49,"The northern part of the DST is subdivided into several segments, although there is some disagreement between scientists as to which faults should be assigned to the DST and which to the EAF, at the northernmost end of the structure."
50,"Following the 2013 Active Fault Map of Turkey, seven DST segments are recognized in Turkey and neighbouring parts of Syria; the Afrin, Sermada, Armanaz, Hacıpaşa, Yesemek, Sakçagöz and Narlı segments."
52,"The EAF has produced large or damaging earthquakes in the past few hundred years along various segments, including the 1789 (M 7."
53,"2, Palu), 1795 (M 7."
54,"0, Pazarcık), 1866 (M 7."

59,"1, Erkenek), 1971 (M6."
60,"6, Karlıova) and 2020 (M 6."
61,"8, Pütürge) events."
62,"Other large historical earthquakes have been tentatively assigned to segments of the EAF, such as the 1114 and 1513 Marash earthquakes, both thought to have ruptured the Pazarcık segment."
63,The Palu and Pütürge segments in the east display a recurrence interval of about 150 years for M 6.
64,8–7.
65,0 earthquakes.
66,"The Pazarcık and Amanos segments in the west have recurrence intervals of 237–772 years and 414–917 years, respectively, for M 7."
67,0–7.
68,4 earthquakes.
69,A research paper published by Earth and Planetary Science Letters in 2002 studied stress accumulation and increased seismic hazard along the East Anatolian Fault.
70,The study concluded two sections of the fault with a considerably high potential for future earthquakes.
71,"One of these sections was in Elazığ and Bingöl, located between the rupture zones of the 1874 and 1971 earthquakes."

183,5 km (12.
184,1 mi) away from the epicenter along the Narlı Fault before it reached the EAF.
185,Back projection suggest the total rupture length was ~560 km (350 mi).
186,The rupture continued northeast onto the Ekernek segment and to the southwest onto the Amanos segment.
187,The northeastern rupture ceased 55 seconds after initiation while the southwestern rupture ceased near Antakya about 80 seconds later.
188,A Mw 6.
189,"8 aftershock occurring 11 minutes later and west of the first M>7 epicenter may have ruptured along the Sakçagöz Fault, the next segment of the Dead Sea Transform to the south."
190,Rupture along the EAF during the event occurred at subshear velocity (maximum 3.
191,2 km (2.
192,0 mi) per second).
193,An analysis of near-field seismic data revealed transient supershear rupture episodes throughout the EAF rupture.
194,Supershear rupture occurred along the northernmost section of the Narlı Fault where it meets the EAF.
195,The rupture transitioned onto the EAF and propagated northeast at supershear velocity until its termination near Malatya.
196,"Rupture towards the southwest was mostly subshear, but at the southern termination in Hatay, where the fault has multiple branches and kinks, supershear was likely observed."
197,Supershear rupture at the southern termination contributed to the intense ground motion in Antakya.
198,"The second M>7 earthquake initiated on a separate fault known as the Çardak–Sürgü Fault Zone, part of the northern strand of the East Anatolian Fault."
199,"The rupture propagated bilaterally along the Çardak segment, continuing eastwards onto the Sürgü segment before continuing eastwards to Malatya along the northeast–southwest trending Doğanşehir Fault Zone."

220,"The zone of surface rupture extended from north of Antakya, Hatay Province towards Pazarcık, Kahramanmaraş Province and Gölbaşı, Adıyaman Province."
221,Surface ruptures continued north of these cities.
222,Surface rupture occurred in the Amik Valley.
223,The westernmost part of Hatay Airport was damaged by surface ruptures but cracks in the runway were attributed to ground deformation.

265,8 rupture on the East Anatolian Fault from Antakya to Golbasi.
266,"Liquefaction and lateral spreading were observed at and near coastal areas, fluvial valleys and drained lake or swamp areas, covered by Holocene sediments."
267,"These effects were widespread in the Amik Valley and Orontes River plain, north of Antakya, Hatay Province."
268,Limited observations were made in high-elevation areas due to snow cover and lack of satellite observations.
269,Liquefaction was also observed in Samandağ.

271,Parts of the lakeshore were also submerged.
272,Gölbaşı was also damaged by liquefaction and lateral spreading.
274,Subsidence due to lateral spreading caused extensive damage in İskenderun.
275,Liquefaction produced sand ejecta that buried Atatürk Boulevard in Çay District.
276,Regular flooding in the city was observed after the earthquakes.
277,Earlier flooding may be attributed to liquefaction while subsequent occurrences may be due to damage to the coast and water infrastructure.
278,The sea inundated parts of the city by as much as 200 m (660 ft).
279,Large areas of the coast and sections of piers were flooded due to lateral spreading.
280,Large waves from bad weather and a tsunami may have contributed to the effects observed at İskenderun.
281,Both earthquakes caused shaking levels (≥0.
282,"12 g) sufficient for landslide-triggering across a 90,000 km2 (35,000 sq mi) area."
283,"About 3,673 earthquake-triggered landslides were identified using satellite imagery, aerial photos, and one field survey of the area."
284,Landslides mainly occurred in the northern region of the affected area.
285,"Rockslides were the most commonly observed; there were also many bedrock rotational landslides, translational slides and lateral spreads."
286,Surface ruptures propagating through hillsides also triggered landslides.
287,"These landslides blocked roads and river channels, destroyed or seriously damaged buildings and caused many deaths."
288,"One of the largest landslides occurred near Tepehan village, Hatay Province; a translational slide which detached a block 1."
289,3 km2 (0.

296,It was the first recorded tsunami in the eastern Mediterranean Sea region since that produced after a 1953 ML  6.
297,2 earthquake in Cyprus.
298,The largest wave measured 40 cm (16 in) along the Mediterranean coast of Turkey.
299,"Although no underwater surveys results have been made available to identify the sources of these tsunamis, they were likely produced by landsliding at Iskenderun Port and liquefaction on the coastal flatlands of Antakya."
300,"Small tsunami waves were recorded off the coast of Famagusta, Cyprus, without damage."
301,The tsunami measured 0.
302,17 m (6.
303,"7 in), and tsunami waves were recorded at 0."
